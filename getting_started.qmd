```{r}
#| label: setup

# This is an R code chunk that sets up some default parameters, loads the data,
# and loads the ggplot library. DO NOT EDIT THIS CODE CHUNK. Whenever you start
# working on your project, you should use the green play button on the right,
# to load all the data and settings here.

## Instructions

Please do not modify anything above this section, except for your name in the author field at the top.

The purpose of this assignment is to **confirm** that you have created an account on RStudio Cloud and are able to knit an R Markdown document.

This is a new paragraph.

## Biography

Hi I am Aaron Gullickson, an associate professor at UO. I like dinosaurs!

## Using R Code Chunks

```{r}
#| label: calculate-stats

# We can use R code chunks to write R code and have the output in our knitted document.
mean(earnings$wages)
tapply(earnings$wages, earnings$gender, mean)
cor(earnings$wages, earnings$age)
```

## Here is a pretty picture

```{r}
#| label: fig-pretty
#| fig-cap: Comparative boxplots of movie runtime by genre. Outliers are shown in red.

# This is an R code chunk. The R code here is producing a figure that will be
# displayed when the R Markdown document is knit. You can get a preview of this
# figure by hitting the green play button on the right. You can use this R code
# chunk as a template for your own by copying and pasting, but you should
# replace the code with proper code for the assignment. Also remember to change
# the caption in the code chunk header above (where it says "fig-cap").
ggplot(movies, aes(x=reorder(genre, runtime, median), y=runtime))+
  geom_boxplot(fill="skyblue", outlier.color = "red")+
  coord_flip()+
  labs(x=NULL, y="runtime in minutes")+
  theme_bw()
```
